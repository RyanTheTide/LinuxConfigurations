LinuxConfigurations

A collection of my personal Linux configurations, scripts, and dotfiles.
This repository is primarily designed for Arch Linux installations, but many of the scripts and configuration files can be adapted to other distributions.

Repository Structure
LinuxConfigurations/
├── dotfiles/     # User configuration files (.zshrc, .config/, etc.)
├── refind/       # rEFInd boot manager themes and configuration
└── scripts/      # Installation and setup helper scripts

Features
	•	Pre-configured dotfiles for shell (Zsh), terminal prompts, and other tools.
	•	Automated setup scripts for Arch Linux, including:
	•	Disk partitioning and filesystem layout.
	•	rEFInd boot manager configuration.
	•	System defaults (locales, keymaps, etc.).
	•	rEFInd themes for a clean multi-boot experience.

Notes
	•	These configurations are opinionated and tailored for my systems.
	•	You may need to adjust scripts or configs for your hardware (e.g. timezone, locales, etc).
	•	Back up your data before running any installation scripts — they will completely wipe the target disk.
